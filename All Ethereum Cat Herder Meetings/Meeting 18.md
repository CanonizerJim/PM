1. EEA Devcon Workshop
Ron Resnick and Paul DiMarzio provided EEA background. Attendees made introductions. EEA wants to build a closer relationship and engagements with the Ethereum community, including the Cat Herders and Magicians, as well as the enterprise companies that purchase solutions from Ethereum developers and consumers. 

Approved to have an open forum co-hosted by the EEA, the Cat Herders, and Ethereum Magicians and the Foundation. Forum is 1.5 hours. Launching a working group on the Ethereum mainnet. Agenda includes 10 minutes of introductions, followed by the EEA roadmap.

EEA has an open req for a Technical Director. Everyone agreed to open a public communication channel on Gitter - https://gitter.im/ethereum-cat-herders/EEA-mainnet. Hugo Sanchez suggested discussing specific issues and use cases enterprises may be having. 
1. Hard Fork Coordination Update
There was a proposal to change the name of hard forks going forward. Naming convention would be to use where the Devcon takes place. We'll be waiting for Parady to finish the implementation and come up with a block number to execute the fork. 

All core dev meetings will be at 14:00 UTC. 

At (26:13), Pooja said EIP 1884 needs further discussion and discussed different suggestions. 

Tim Beiko recommended creating a blog post that discussed all the EIPs that will be included in the next fork. Brett Robertson suggested discussing this after the meeting in the Gitter channel. Pooja suggested updating their website to do the same. Tim Beiko pointed out that the EIPs that will be included are listed in the Istanbul Tracker tracker: https://notes.ethereum.org/@holiman/SyT_rGjNr

   1. Update on Gitcoin discrepancy
Nothing has been determined about what the problem is beyond the Gitcoin discrepancy. Brent Allsop took an action item to look into this in more detail. This link to the ProgPow Gitcoin funding page - https://gitcoin.co/grants/82/official-progpow-technical-audit-funding?tab=activity - has all the contributed DAI listed. The total listed on that page is about 3% less than all the DAI contributed. This is the only known problem.
